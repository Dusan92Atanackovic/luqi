pyqt branch is currently active branch (qorks with PyQt4 as GUI base), but master branch also works (works with tkinter as GUI base)

# RUN
new luqi.py  /   luqi.py from pyqt branch

# luqi

This program is still developing, it is open source so all changes are possible.
I am trying to make quick installer for linux with GUI, by storing commands into db instead of remembering them and than call an terminal which will execute the commands

luqi.py is  old version of programm 
  - not developing anymore, but file remains because of the code that might be used again
  - it uses configs directory instead of db (that's why it is old)
